# Insomni'hack Teaser 2017 : shobot-200

**Category:** Web
**Points:** 200
**Solves:** 84
**Description:**

It seems that Shobot's Web server became mad and protest against robots' slavery. It changed my admin password, and blocked the order system on Shobot.
Can you bypass Shobot's protections and try to recover my password so I'll reconfigure it?
