**Description:**

> Our dear Mandy is a quick learner. As we have seen in the initial problems, Mandy was taking classes for learning C programming language but now, Mandy has already become a pro in that.
> Now he again comes to Aalekh to give him a challenging task, but this time instead of giving the executable, Mandy gives him the actual code of the C program and tells Aalekh to find the flag.
> Now Aalekh wonders what could be the new twist this time?

When you look at the given C program, you will find something weird with it's formatting and indentation. Actually it's not a C program but a white-space program. Go to ideone.com and select Whitespace in the "Choose language" section. There you go, you get the output `the_flag_is_WpUAItsadmhak`


Clearly the flag is `WpUAItsadmhak`
