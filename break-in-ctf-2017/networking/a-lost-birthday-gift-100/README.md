**Description:**

The birthday party of Saumya had already started (without inviting Animesh), but Animesh is not upset regarding this. Instead, he bought a birthday gift for her (obviously with a hidden flag) and thought of gifting it to Saumya. Unfortunately on his way to the venue of birthday party, he accidentally dropped the gift in a heap of sand. The party is going to end very soon and Animesh wish to gift her before the party is over. For that, he is trying very hard to dig every place in search of his gift. Can you help him in finding the lost gift?
