**Description:**

Our dear Mandy is a quick learner. As we have seen in the initial problems, Mandy was taking classes for learning C programming language but now, Mandy has already become a pro in that. Now he again comes to Aalekh to give him a challenging task, but this time instead of giving the executable, Mandy gives him the actual code of the C program and tells Aalekh to find the flag. Now Aalekh wonders what could be the new twist this time?
