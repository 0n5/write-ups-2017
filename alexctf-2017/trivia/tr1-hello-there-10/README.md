## Write-up

The idiom "Drop us a few lines" commonly refers to chatting. Browsing the CTF page, the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel `#alexctf` is openly displayed. [Connect to the channel over IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IRC/Tutorial) (I suggest using [Freenode](freenode.net) for this challenge). The channel's topic/description is `Alexandria University student held capture the flag event ctf.oddcoder.com ALEXCTF{W3_w15h_y0u_g00d_luck}`. Submit the flag for points.
