# BSides San Francisco CTF 2017 : root-250

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 250

**Description:**

Our guy inside e-corp was able to get that packet capture of their backend PKI you asked for. Unfortunately it seems they're using TLS to protect the modulus fetch. Now, I have been told that the best crackers in the world can do this in 60 minutes. Unfortunately I need someone who can do it in 60 seconds.

Note: Flag does not follow the "Flag:" format but is recognizable
