# BSides San Francisco CTF 2017 : in-plain-sight-100

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 100
**Solves:** 23
**Description:**

This level is simple: all you have to do is decrypt some HiddenCiphertext! To make it even easier, I'll give you everything you need, except the ciphertext; you have to find that on your own!

You will need:

* Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
* Key: c086e08ad8ee0ebe7c2320099cfec9eea9a346a108570a4f6494cfe7c2a30ee1
* IV: 0a0e176722a95a623f47fa17f02cc16a

(Hint: As usual, the flag will start with 'FLAG:', so you'll know when you've found it :) )
